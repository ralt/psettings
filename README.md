vim-modes
===

Description
---

This plugin tries to emulate something close to emacs modes.

It allows you to have different vim settings for each project.

If you're working with different coding standards (X project has shiftwidth 2,
Y project has shiftwidth 4, etc), it can become cumbersome to always work with
vim.

This project solves this.

Usage
---

    :call Mode("Drupal")

Currently, this is the only API available. But this plugin was created last
night.
