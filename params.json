{"name":"Psettings","tagline":"Allows you to have per-project settings files for vim.","body":"psettings aka Project Settings\r\n===\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis plugin allows you to have different vim settings for each project.\r\n\r\nIf you're working with different coding standards (X project has shiftwidth 2,\r\nY project has shiftwidth 4, etc), it can become cumbersome to always work with\r\nvim.\r\n\r\nThis project solves this.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n---\r\n\r\nPut a `.psettings` file at the root of your project. In this file, put the\r\nfollowing line:\r\n\r\n    Drupal\r\n\r\nThat is, if you want to use the `Drupal` project settings.\r\n\r\nThe default settings are in the `settings/` folder of this plugin. You can add\r\nyour own settings folder by putting the following in your vimrc:\r\n\r\n    let g:psettings_custom_path = '/your/path/to/settings/'\r\n\r\nIf a settings file is found in both folders, both will be used.\r\n\r\nThe names you put in the `.psettings` file must match the filename of the\r\nsettings file, less the `.vim` extension.\r\n\r\nYou can put several project settings in your `.psettings` file, each settings\r\nfile will be read sequentially. This allows you to have one \"major\" settings\r\nfile(for example, all the projects in the PHP language), and several \"minor\"\r\nsettings modes (Drupal projects, Symfony projects, Zend projects, etc).\r\n\r\nIf you simply want to run a project settings, you can also run the following\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n    :call Psettings(\"Drupal\")\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n---\r\n\r\nSee the [issue queue][0].\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [Florian Margaine](http://margaine.com)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---\r\n\r\nMIT License.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [0]: https://github.com/Ralt/psettings/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open","google":"UA-25548348-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
